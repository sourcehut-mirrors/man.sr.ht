        You've successfully created your wiki, but it does not have any content
        yet. Your repository is now available at
        <code>{{repo_uri(wiki.owner.username, wiki.name)}}</code>.
        To populate the index page, clone the repository and add an
        <code>index.md</code> file. Commit it and push to the master branch and
        you'll see the changes here.
